        <h2>Digital Nook</h2>
        <p>
            In 2019, I founded <a href="https://digitalnook.net">digitalnook.net</a> as a way for me to learn about
            web development. I started off by making some small utilities and JavaScript games for friends and family.
            This helped me learn a lot about the Flask framework, SQL, Jinja2 templating, and frontend development.
            <br><br>
            The project has since evolved into a Sydney based Minecraft network that facilitates a small community. We
            host Survival and Creative servers with 99% uptime, regular backups, and anti-griefing protection. This has
            given me invaluable experience with Unix server administration.

        <h2>Maze generation and solving</h2>
        <p>
            For this project I challenged myself to create a maze image generator without searching for existing
            algorithms. The result is far from perfect, but it sure is unique!
            <br><br>
            After that, I created a maze solving program that can find the fastest path through the maze images.
            <br><br>
            This project taught me a lot about working with images in Python using the Pillow library.

        <h2>Personal Site</h2>
        <p>
            This website was built using all the knowledge I gained from my mistakes with Digital Nook. I learned the
            Django framework and further honed my frontend skills to create a beautiful, minimalist, and mobile-friendly
            portfolio page.

        <h2>Boomer Bot</h2>
        <p>
            I made a telegram bot that detects boomers and sends "Ok Boomer" to the chat.
